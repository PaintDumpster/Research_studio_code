# NEBuilder: An AI-Driven Sustainability Design Assistant

## 🌍 Overview
NEBuilder is a platform inspired by the New European Bauhaus (NEB) initiative. It bridges complex sustainability guidelines with practical design implementation using graph-based tools and generative AI.

## 🎯 Core Objectives
- **Simplify NEB Guidelines** into accessible, designer-friendly tools.
- **Focus on Façades**, which influence 17% of NEB's metrics.
- **Optimize Early Design Phases** for maximal sustainability impact.

## 🧠 Key Technologies
- **Graph Database**: `Neo4j`
- **Data Processing**: `pandas`, `geopandas`, `tqdm`
- **Graph Analysis & Visualization**: `umap-learn`, `kumu`
- **AI Integration**: `langchain` for natural language Cypher query generation

## ⚙️ Workflow
- Upload building models + site location.
- Auto-fetch weather data and suggest sustainable wall assemblies.
- Return compliance metrics + material suggestions.

## 🚀 Planned Enhancements
- Semantic analysis of textual guidelines.
- Integration of real-world parametric models.
- Neural Language Models (NLMs) for advanced querying.

## 💡 Impact
Facilitates NEB-aligned design decisions by demystifying regulatory complexities and promoting intuitive, data-driven sustainability.
